- Edit an existing note card: Users can edit the details of an existing note card, rather than having to delete and recreate it.
- Add a checklist to a note card: Users can add a checklist to a note card to help them stay organized and on top of their tasks.
- Trash: Users can move note cards to a trash folder instead of deleting them immediately. This can help prevent accidental deletions and make it easier to recover important notes.
